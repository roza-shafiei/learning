- The issue is that Pinia stores are not components,
 so useRouter() does not work directly inside them. useRouter() only works inside Vue components or the setup() function.

 - using navigation guards for dynamic title, check authentication
 - filter courses
 - using stores inside router guards/ it should be inside functions
